        <p> One of my favorite artists of all time is Genndy Tartakovsky. 
        Not only has he created some of the best animated shows in 
        the past three decades, but he is both flexible in his artistic 
        style and humble during collaborations. Throughout his three
        decades in the animation industry, Tartakovsky's art evolved
        from comedic slapstick to realistically brutal action with
        no sign of slowing down in 2025.</p>

<h2>Early Life</h2>
<img src="Images/YoungGenndy.png"><div class="flex-half">
</div>
<p> Born January 17th, 1970 in Moscow to Jewish parents, 
Tartakovsky’s family was well off because his father 
was a dentist and his mother was a vice principal. 
But with antisemitism growing in Russia, the family 
immigrated to Italy where Tartakovsky got his first
taste for drawing. After moving to Chicago, Illinois, 
Tartakovsky marinated himself in American culture by 
watching cartoons like <i>The Super Friends</i> and
reading comic books. 
            
<h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
<Img src="Images/CalARTS.png.jpg">

<p>After High school, Tartakovsky attended
Columbia College Chicago. Encoraged by his
family to major in business, he was too late in
signing up for advertising class, and instead
enrolled in animation. From there, the medium
consumed him as he drew picture after picture
building a portfolio.

When his brother Alex moved for college, he 
bunked with Rob Renzetti. Renzetti and Genddy
bonded over their love for animation and several
weeks later, they were accepted to the California
Institute of the Arts.It was there that Tartakovsky
met two more lifelong collaborators friends: 
Paul Rudish and Craig McCracken.</p>

<p>After Graduating CalArts, Tartakovsky was hired by
Lapiz Azul Productions where he worked on <i>Batman:
The Animated Series</i> and learned about the labor
intensive environment of his career.A few years later, 
McCracken got him hired at Hanna-Barbera where he worked 
on Donovan Cook's <I>2 Stupid Dogs</I></p>.

<p>While working on  <i>2 Stupid Dogs</i>, Tartakovsky 
expanded on one of his student films from CALARTS. 
After refining the story and producing the animation, 
he presented it to Fred Siebert, who entered it into 
Cartoon Network's <I>What a Cartoon Show!</I> 
which spotlighted new shorts from upcoming talent. 
The name of the show?<i>Dexter's Laboratory</i>:</p> 
<img src="Images/Dexter'sLaboratory.png">
                       
 <p><i>Dexter's Laboratory</i> was one of the top three highest
rated pilots on the <i>What a Cartoon Show!</i> alongside 
<i>The Powerpuff Girls</i> which was created by his colleague, McCracken. 
In fact, Tartakovsky and McCracken were such good friends 
that they coproduced and codirected several episodes of each other's shows. 
Both <i>Dexter's Laboratory</i> and <i>The Powerpuff Girls</i> were 
nominated for seveal emmys and annie awards throughout the 1990s and early 2000's, 
and Tartakovsky even served as the animation director for <i>The Powerpuff Girls Movie</i>:</p>

<li><p>Showrunner of <i>Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003)</i>.
George Lucas was so impressed with <i>Samurai Jack</i>
that he comissioned Tartakovsky to develop a mini-series
bridging the gap between <i>Attack of the Clones</i>
and <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>.The result is the best
<i>Star Wars</i> narrative from the prequel era until the
eventual 3D <i>Clone Wars</i> in 2008. No other animators
could've pulled this off better than Tartakovsky with his
growing experience in action. He eve fixed the dialogue that
Harrison Ford critcized in the original trilogy.</p>

<H2>Challenges and Obstacles</H2>
<p>Tartakovsky's road to fame was fraught with hardships. 
At age 16, his father died of a heart attack, and 
the family moved into government funded housing. 
For several years, Tartakovsky worked a job in highschool
while building his portfolio. A few months after he was hired
at Lapiz Azul Productions, his mother died from cancer leaving 
him in turmoil, though his brother Alex encouraged him to stay 
on his career path.</p>
                    
<p>Despite his reputation in the animation industry, not all of his 
projets saw the light of day. While the <i>Hotel Transylvania</i>
movies were financially successfully, Sony pulled the plug on both
<i>Can You Imagine</i> and <i>Popeye</i> despite the positive
reception towards the latter's animation test.</p>
